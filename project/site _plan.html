            <h1>Site Purpose: Partido Boulevard</h1>
            <p>The two-kilometer completed portion of the coastal by-pass road in Barangay Tagas, San Jose, Camarines Sur, has already become a tourist attraction among local residents and tourists from neighboring towns and places in the province. The road project officially called "Construction of By-pass and Diversion Road, Junction of Nato-Sagnay Road, Tagas Section, Barangay Tagas, San Jose, Camarines Sur" is being implemented by the Camarines Sur 4th District Engineering Office of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).</p>
            <p>Town officials are optimistic that the boulevard will open business opportunities in the area, such as beach resorts, hotels, restaurants, souvenir stores, and other tourism-related shops.</p>

            <p>The color scheme refers to the carefully selected site colors. I am going to use green as the background color and red for the details of my website, along with other colors from the palette for accents, etc.</p>
